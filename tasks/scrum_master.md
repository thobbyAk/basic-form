# Scrum Master Task

## Overview 
This task is an exercise where we expect you to showcase your ability to run a team or group retrospective. We are interested in seeing your approach when interacting, as well as organising a retrospective style discussion with a few individuals in a mock meeting, in a style of your choosing.  

### Therefore:
- You can conduct the meeting with or without the use of an online / cloud software solution, to facilitate the retrospective itself of course.  
- There is no need to do anykind of presentation.

The meeting should should take no more than 15-20 minutes, but do not worry if you go over this. Your approach will then form part of feedback discussion internally with some of the managers in our hiring process.

Due to the current ways of working and the geographical distribution of our engineering teams, the meeting won't take place face to face, but of course over Zoom. A meeting link will be provided to you in advance, along with the meeting participants details.  

Good luck and enjoy!
